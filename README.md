## About Me
I am a curious learmer with a background in infrastructure and statistics. Inspired by my go-to stat page statmike, I too love to learn 'almost' as much as I love to share what I have learnt. These days I am delving into what they call DataOps or Data Centric AI,  and what I label as Data Parent.
