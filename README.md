# Hi there, I'm Haely ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a curious learner with a background in infrastructure and statistics. I love to learn *almost* as much as I love to share what I have learnt. These days I am delving into what they call DataOps or Data Centric AI, and what I label as Data Parenting.


## My Interests
- Cloud Optimization (Google Cloud Platform, AWS)
- Machine Learning/Data Operations (ML/DataOps)
- NLP on Non-Latin languages
  
## Recent Projects
- https://github.com/haely/DataParenting/blob/main/README.md

## Get in Touch
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/haelyshah/

## Fun Fact
1. I love statistical paradoxes and I am told that I force them into everything I read and write.
2. 1995 BBC Pride&Prejudice >>> all of them
