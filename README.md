# Hello, World ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am an ML/software engineer with a background in infrastructure and statistics. I love to learn *almost* as much as I love to share what I have learnt. My interests in mathematics, data analysis, infra, and efficiency/optmality in all things bring me to always research, share, and optimize. These days I am learning and experimenting on making ML solutions more efficient and accessible. This has drawn me to taking a course in TinyML and learning about its potential to bring the power of AI to resource-constrained devices.

## My Interests

- Cloud & ML Optimization (Google Cloud Platform, AWS)
- Machine Learning/Data Operations (ML/DataOps)
- TinyML

## Recent Projects

- **TinyML Experiments:**  https://github.com/haely/TinyMLnotes -  Exploring TinyML techniques like pruning and distillation, and building an Android app that runs a TensorFlow Lite model.
