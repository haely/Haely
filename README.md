# Hi there, I'm Haely ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a curious learner with a background in infrastructure and statistics. I love to learn *almost* as much as I love to share what I have learnt. My interests in mathematics, data analysis, infra, and efficiency/optmality in all things bring me to always research, share, and optimize. These days I am delving into what they call Data/MLOps or Data Centric AI, and what I label as Data/ML Parenting.


## My Interests
- Cloud Optimization (Google Cloud Platform, AWS)
- Machine Learning/Data Operations (ML/DataOps)
- NLP on Non-Latin languages

## Fun Fact
